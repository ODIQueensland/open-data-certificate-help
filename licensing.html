<h2>How do you give people permission to use this data?</h2>
<p>In the Licensing section of the Open Data Certificate questionnaire, you answer one or more questions about how your data is licensed so others can use it. The questions you are shown are based on your answers to previous questions - the logic is shown in this <a href="https://github.com/ODIQueensland/open-data-certificate-help/issues/8" title="coming soon">flowchart</a>.</p>
<p>Start with question 1 to work through the questions relevant to you and access resources to help you improve the way you licence data.</p>

<h2 class="question" id="copyrightURL">1. Where have you published the rights statement for this dataset?</h2>
Give the URL to a page that describes the right to re-use this dataset. This should include a reference to its <a href="http://queensland.theodi.org/home/glossary/#licence">licence</a> or copyright <a href="http://queensland.theodi.org/home/glossary/#waiver">waiver</a>, <a href="http://queensland.theodi.org/home/glossary/#attribution">attribution </a>requirements, and a statement about relevant copyright. A rights statement helps people understand what they can and can't do with the data.
<h3 class="answer">Copyright URL</h3>
You should publish a rights statement that details copyright, licensing and how people should give attribution to the data.

  <a title="Under which licence or waiver can people reuse this data?" href="#dataLicence">Next: Question 2</a>
</div>
<div class="note">
<p>Enter the web address (url) of the page that provides copyright and license information. You can often find it on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the page where you access the data. e.g.</li>
      <ul>
        <li> Licence: <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution</a></li>
        <li><a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"><img alt="Creative Commons License" style="border-width:0" src="https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by/4.0/80x15.png" /></a></li>
      </ul>
    <li>the site's "Copyright" or "Terms and Conditions" page; often accessible via the page footer. e.g.</li>

  </ul>
<p>If your data is available in a CKAN open data portal, this question will be automatically answered for you.</p>
<p>This rights statement applies to the whole dataset. If your data includes third-party data, then you should also provide a statement about the third-party copyright nested within the dataset. You'll be asked about this later in the questionnaire.</p>
</div>

<h2 class="question" id="dataLicence">2. Under which licence or waiver can people reuse this data?</h2>
Remember that whoever spends intellectual effort creating content automatically gets rights over it. Creative content includes the organisation and selection of items within data, but does not include facts. You need to provide a waiver or a licence which informs people how they can legally use the data.

We list the most common licenses used in Australia.

<h2 class="question" id="otherDataLicenceOpen">5. Is the licence an open licence?</h2>
If you aren't sure what an open licence is, then read the <a href="http://opendefinition.org/">Open Definition</a> by <a href="http://okfn.org/">Open Knowledge</a>. Review the <a href="http://opendefinition.org/licenses/">Open Definition Conformant Licences</a> to check if your licence is open. If your licence isn't listed, it's either not open or hasn't been assessed yet.
<h3 class="answer">Yes</h3>
Answer, "Yes" if your licence is listed as open on the <a href="http://opendefinition.org/licenses/">Open Definition Conformant Licences</a> list.
<div class="next">
  <a title="Is there any third-party data included in your data?" href="#10">Next: Question 10</a>

<h3 class="answer">No</h3>
You must publish open data under an open licence so that people can use it.

<h2 class="question" id="6" >6. Why doesn't a licence apply to this data?</h2>
<h3 class="answer">There is no copyright in the data</h3>
There is no copyright in factual information. If the data does not contain any content that was created through intellectual effort, there are no rights in the content.
<div class="note">
Copyright only applies to data if you spent intellectual effort creating what's in it, for example, by writing text that's within the data, or deciding whether particular data is included. There's no copyright if the data only contains facts where no judgements were made about whether to include them or not.

The CC0 is a document in which the user purports to abandon all claim to copyright and related rights. It is not a licence. Whilst you could apply a CC0 Waiver, there are some doubts about its force under Australian law, particularly with respect to <a href="http://queensland.odinodes.wpengine.com/home/glossary#moral-rights">moral rights</a>. Furthermore, the disclaimer that accompanies CC0, at present, may be ineffective in protecting the user from liability for claims of negligence.

<h2 class="question"  id="explicitWaiver">9. Is the data marked as Public Domain?</h2>
Works in the public domain are those whose intellectual property rights have expired, have been forfeited, or are inapplicable. If none of the content of your data have copyright or other rights over it, it is good practice to explicitly state this by labelling it as ‘public domain’. You can do this by using the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/">Creative Commons Public Domain Mark</a> or a <a href="http://www.ausgoal.gov.au/no-copyright">no known rights statement</a>.
<div class="ednote">
<div class="ednote-title">Editor's Note</div>
Creative Common at https://creativecommons.org/about/pdm/ seems to emphasise using PDM for works with expired copyright or already in the public domain. Is this mark appropriate for adding to raw data collected from sensors?

<h2 class="question" id="10">10. Is there any third-party data included in your data?</h2>
In some data, the rights in different records are held by different people or organisations. Where these nested rights carry different restrictions, the dataset will inherit, in total, the most restrictive of the nested restrictions.

For example, if two nested elements of data are licensed CC-BY and CC-BY-NC, the entire dataset will need to be licensed CC-BY-NC, which by definition would prevent it from being ‘open’ data. There may be an exception to this rule if the user can clearly identify the nested data elements and the restrictions that apply to them.

It's good practice to embed information about rights in machine-readable formats so people can automatically attribute this data back to you when they use it. Read the <a href="http://theodi.org/guides/publishers-guide-to-the-open-data-rights-statement-vocabulary">Publisher's Guide to the Open Data Rights Statement Vocabulary</a> to find out how.
