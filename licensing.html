<h2>How do you give people permission to use this data?</h2>
In the Licensing section of the Open Data Certificate questionnaire, you may answer one or more questions that are progressively shown based on this <a href="http://queensland.odinodes.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2016/02/certificate-licensing-flowchart-2016-02-251.pdf" target="_blank">flowchart</a>.

<h2 class="question" id="copyrightURL">1. Where have you published the rights statement for this dataset?</h2>
Give the URL to a page that describes the right to re-use this dataset. This should include a reference to its <a href="http://queensland.theodi.org/home/glossary/#licence">license</a> or copyright <a href="http://queensland.theodi.org/home/glossary/#waiver">waiver</a>, <a href="http://queensland.theodi.org/home/glossary/#attribution">attribution </a>requirements, and a statement about relevant copyright. A rights statement helps people understand what they can and can't do with the data.
<h3 class="answer" id="copyrightURL">Copyright URL</h3>
You should publish a rights statement that details copyright, licensing and how people should give attribution to the data.
<div class="example">
<div class="example-title">Example</div>
If your data is published on a web page, consider using the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/choose/">Creative Commons Licence Chooser</a> or the <a title="Creative Commons public domain mark chooser" href="http://creativecommons.org/choose/mark/">Public Domain Mark Chooser</a> to generate a rights statement and place it on the web page where your data can be accessed. These tools can generate both a human‑readable and machine‑readable rights statement. E.g.
<blockquote><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" rel="license"><img style="border-width: 0" src="https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by/4.0/80x15.png" alt="Creative Commons License" /></a>

This rights statement applies to the whole dataset. If your data includes third-party data then you should also provide a statement about the third-party copyrights nested within the dataset.

<div class="next"><a title="Is there any copyright in the data?" href="#contentRights">Next: Question 2</a></div>

<h2 class="question" id="contentRights">2. Is there any copyright in the data?</h2>
<h3 class="answer">No, the data only contains facts and numbers, or copyright has expired</h3>
There is no copyright in factual information. If the data does not contain any content that was created through intellectual effort, there are no rights in the content.
<div class="note">
<div class="note-title">Note</div>
Copyright only applies to data if you spent intellectual effort creating what's in it, for example, by writing text that's within the data, or deciding whether particular data is included. There's no copyright if the data only contains facts where no judgements were made about whether to include them or not.

<hr />

Copyright vests (is considered to exist) immediately upon creation of a work, and expires 70 years after the death of the author. (<a href="http://queensland.odinodes.wpengine.com/home/glossary#crown-copyright">Crown copyright</a> has a different duration).

  <a title="Is the data marked as Public Domain?" href="#explicitWaiver">Next: Question 3</a>
</div>

<h3 class="answer">Yes, and the rights are all held by the same person or organisation</h3>
Choose this option if the content in the data was all created by or transferred to the same person or organisation.
<div class="next"><a href="#dataLicence">Next: Question 5</a></div>

<h3 class="answer">Yes, and the rights are held by different people or organisations</h3>
In some data, the rights in different records are held by different people or organisations. Information about rights needs to be kept in the data too.
<div class="note">
<div class="note-title">Note</div>
In some data, the rights in different records are held by different people or organisations. Where these nested rights carry different restrictions, the dataset will inherit, in total, the most restrictive of the nested restrictions. For example, if two nested elements of data are licensed CC-BY and CC-BY-NC, the entire dataset will need to be licensed CC-BY-NC, which by definition would prevent it from being ‘open’ data. There may be an exception to this rule if the user can clearly identify the nested data elements and the restrictions that apply to them.

<div class="next"><a href="#contentRightsURL">Next: Question 4</a></div>

<h2 class="question"  id="explicitWaiver">3. Is the data marked as Public Domain?</h2>
Works in the public domain are those whose intellectual property rights have expired, have been forfeited, or are inapplicable. If none of the content of your data have copyright or other rights over it, it is good practice to explicitly state this by labelling it as ‘public domain’. You can do this by using the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/">Creative Commons Public Domain Mark</a> or a <a href="http://www.ausgoal.gov.au/no-copyright">no known rights statement</a>.
<div class="ednote">
<div class="ednote-title">Editor's Note</div>
Creative Common at https://creativecommons.org/about/pdm/ seems to emphasise using PDM for works with expired copyright or already in the public domain. Is this mark appropriate for adding to raw data collected from sensors?

<h2 class="question" id="contentRightsURL">4. Where are the rights and licencing of third-party data explained?</h2>
Give the URL for a page where you describe how someone can find out the rights and licensing of third-party data nested within the dataset.
<div class="next"><a title="Under which licence or waiver can people reuse this data?" href="#dataLicence">Next: Question 5</a></div>

<h2 class="question" id="dataLicence">5. Under which licence or waiver can people reuse this data?</h2>
Remember that whoever spends intellectual effort creating content automatically gets rights over it. Creative content includes the organisation and selection of items within data, but does not include facts. You need to provide a waiver or a licence which informs people how they can legally use the data.

We list the most common licenses used in Australia.

<div class="note">
<div class="note-title">Note</div>
The CC0 is a document in which the user purports to abandon all claim to copyright and related rights. It is not a licence. Whilst you could apply a CC0 Waiver, there are some doubts about its force under Australian law, particularly with respect to <a href="http://queensland.odinodes.wpengine.com/home/glossary#moral-rights">moral rights</a>. Furthermore, the disclaimer that accompanies CC0, at present, may be ineffective in protecting the user from liability for claims of negligence.

<div class="next"><a title="What is the name of the licence?" href="#otherDataLicenceName">Next: Question 6</a></div>


<h2 class="question" id="otherDataLicenceName" >6. What is the name of the licence?</h2>
If you use a different licence, we need its name so people can see it on your Open Data Certificate.
<div class="next"><a title="Where is the licence?" href="#otherDataLicenceURL">Next: Question 7</a></div>

<h2 class="question" id="otherDataLicenceURL">7. Where is the licence?</h2>
Give a URL to the licence, so people can see it on your Open Data Certificate and check that it's publicly available.
<div class="next"><a title="Is the licence an open licence?" href="#otherDataLicenceOpen">Next: Question 8</a></div>

<h2 class="question" id="otherDataLicenceOpen">8. Is the licence an open licence?</h2>
If you aren't sure what an open licence is, then read the <a href="http://opendefinition.org/">Open Definition</a> by <a href="http://okfn.org/">Open Knowledge</a>. Review the <a href="http://opendefinition.org/licenses/">Open Definition Conformant Licences</a> to check if your licence is open. If your licence isn't listed, it's either not open or hasn't been assessed yet.
<h3 class="answer">Yes</h3>
Answer, "Yes" if your licence is listed as open on the <a href="http://opendefinition.org/licenses/">Open Definition Conformant Licences</a> list.
<div class="next"><a title="Do you have a machine-readable rights statement?" href="#copyrightStatementMetadata">Next: Question 9</a></div>

<h3 class="answer">No</h3>
You must publish open data under an open licence so that people can use it.

<h2 class="question" id="copyrightStatementMetadata">9. Do you have a machine-readable rights statement?</h2>
It's good practice to embed information about rights in machine-readable formats so people can automatically attribute this data back to you when they use it.
