<h2>How do you protect people's privacy?</h2>
<p>In the Privacy section of the Open Data Certificate questionnaire, you answer one or more questions about how you protect people's privacy in the data you publish. The questions you are shown are based on your answers to previous questions – the logic is shown in this <a href="http://queensland.theodi.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2016/11/certificate-privacy-flowchart-2016-11-29.pdf"  target="_blank">flowchart</a>.</p>

<div class="note-title">Privacy Laws</div>
<p>In Australia, privacy laws do not bind everyone. For example:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A03712" target="_blank">Commonwealth Privacy Act 1988</a> binds Commonwealth Government departments and businesses with a turnover greater than $3 million and private health service providers.</li>
 	<li>the <a href="https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/LEGISLTN/CURRENT/I/InfoPrivA09.pdf" target="_blank">Queensland Information Privacy Act 2009</a> binds Queensland Government Ministers, Departments, Local Governments, public authorities, and their bound contracted service providers. Not all areas of government are bound, for example, Government Owned Corporations, courts or tribunals in relation to their judicial or quasi-judicial functions, among other exemptions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some sectors, particularly health services, may be bound by more than one privacy law.</p>
<p>The Australian Government provides a list of links to <a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy-law/other-privacy-jurisdictions" target="_blank">privacy regulation in the States and Territories</a> and <a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy-law/other-legislation/" target="_blank">other Australian laws that relate to privacy</a>.</p>
