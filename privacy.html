<div class="note-title">Privacy Laws</div>
In Australia, privacy laws do not bind everyone. For example:
<ul>
 	<li>the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A03712" target="_blank">Commonwealth Privacy Act 1988</a> binds Commonwealth Government departments and businesses with a turnover greater than $3 million and private health service providers.</li>
 	<li>the <a href="https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/LEGISLTN/CURRENT/I/InfoPrivA09.pdf" target="_blank">Queensland Information Privacy Act 2009</a> <span style="font-weight: 400">binds Queensland Government Ministers, Departments, Local Governments, public authorities, and their bound contracted service providers. Not all areas of government are bound, for example, Government Owned Corporations, courts or tribunals in relation to their judicial or quasi-judicial functions, among other exemptions.</span></li>
</ul>
Some sectors, particularly health services, may be bound by more than one privacy law.

The Australian Government provides a list of links to <a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy-law/other-privacy-jurisdictions" target="_blank">privacy regulation in the States and Territories</a> and <a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy-law/other-legislation/" target="_blank">other Australian laws that relate to privacy</a>.

<div class="note-title">Sensitive Data</div>
The Open Data Certificate questionnaire focuses on privacy, one element of data sensitivity. Other elements of data sensitivity include:
<ul>
 	<li>commercial-in-confidence</li>
 	<li>secrecy</li>
 	<li>cultural heritage</li>
 	<li>environmental security.</li>
</ul>
It is important to consider all aspects of data sensitivity when publishing data.

<h2><strong>2. Has the data about individuals been de-identified?</strong></h2>
<h5>Yes, the data has been de-identified.</h5>
De-identification techniques such as aggregation, data masking, pseudonymisation, and reducing the precision of information can reduce the risk of individuals being identified in the data.
<p align="right"><a title="Has your de-identification process been independently audited?" href="#dataDeidentifiedAudited">Next: Question 3</a></p>

<h5>No, it contains data that could identify individuals.</h5>
Individual identities are visible in the data or could be reasonably ascertained through cross-referencing with other available information.
