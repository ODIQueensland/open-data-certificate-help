<h2><strong>1. Do you have the rights to publish this data as open data?</strong></h2>
You should have a clear legal <a href="/glossary#rights">right</a> to publish this data. If your organisation didn't originally create or gather this data then you might not have the right to publish it. If you’re not sure, check with the <a href="/glossary#rights-holder">rights holder</a> (owner) because you will need their permission to publish it.
<div class="note">
Your dataset might contain data that has been provided by a third party. If you’re not sure whether you are the rights holder (owner) of the data, look for information about how your dataset was created. There may be owners whose  permission you need to publish the data.

If your data includes data from other sources, the owner of the data must give you permission to publish it. They could do this in several ways, including by:

<ul>
<li>applying an <a href="http://queensland.theodi.org/home/glossary/#open-licence">open licence</a> to the data</li>
<li>providing permission to publish the data under an open licence</li>
<li><a href="http://queensland.theodi.org/glossary#waiver">waiving</a> their copyright in the data, thereby placing it in the <a href="http://queensland.theodi.org/glossary#public-domain">public domain</a>.</li>
</ul>

If the copyright in the data has expired, you don't need permission to publish it.
</div>
<div class="warning">
<div class="warning-title">Editor's Note</div>
Explain how to determine if copyright has expired.
</div>

<h5>Yes</h5>
You have the right to publish the data as open data if you collected all the data yourself.
<p align="right"><a title="Was all this data originally created or gathered by you?" href="#publisherorigins">Next: Question 2</a></p>

<h5>No</h5>
No, you don’t have the rights to publish this data. Without these rights, you cannot publish the data as open data and so cannot earn an open data certificate.
<p align="right"><a title="" href="http://queensland.theodi.org/home/services/certificates/help/negative-ending/">End</a></p>

<h5>Unsure</h5>
You're not sure if you have the rights to publish this data as open data.
<div class="note">
If you are unsure, the Open Data Certificate questionnaire will lead you through a series of questions to help you determine if you have the rights to publish this data. It will ask if all the data was gathered by you and if not, what were the sources of the data and if they are openly licensed.
</div>
<p align="right"><a title="Was all this data originally created or gathered by you?" href="#publisheroriginsunsure">Next: Question 3</a></p>

<h5>It's complicated</h5>
The rights in this data are complicated or unclear. If your organisation didn't originally create or gather this data then you might not have the right to publish it. If you’re not sure, check with the data owner(s) because you will need their permission to publish it.

<div class="warning">
<div class="warning-title">Editor's Note</div>
Explain why "it's complicated" is valid. i.e. I understand the rights; they're just messy. As opposed to, I really don't understand this "rights" thing.

<hr id="publisherorigins" />

&nbsp;
<h2><strong>2. Was all this data originally created or gathered by you?</strong></h2>
If any part of this data was sourced outside your organisation by other individuals or organisations, then you need to give extra information about your right to publish it.
<div class="note">
If your data includes data from other sources, you can publish it if the copyright has expired or each <a href="/glossary#rights-holder">rights holder</a> of the third-party data has given you permission to publish it, by either:
<ul>
 	<li>applying an <a href="/glossary#open-licence">open licence</a> to the data</li>
 	<li>providing you written permission to publish the data under an open licence</li>
 	<li><a href="/glossary#waiver">waiving</a> their copyright in the data, thereby placing it in the <a href="/glossary#public-domain">public domain</a>.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h5>Yes</h5>
If this data was solely collected or created by your organisation, you have the right to publish. Before you publish it you must apply an <a href="/glossary#open-licence">open licence</a> and <a href="http://queensland.theodi.org/home/services/certificates/help/privacy/#dataPersonal">ensure it is not private or sensitive data.</a>
<p align="right"><a title="Licensing" href="http://queensland.odinodes.wpengine.com/home/projects/odc/help/licensing">Next: Licensing Questions</a></p>

<h5>No</h5>
If your data includes data from other sources, unless the copyright has expired, each <a href="/glossary#rights-holder">rights holder</a> of the third-party data must give you permission to publish it as open data.

<hr id="rightsriskassessment" />

&nbsp;
<h2><strong>4. Where do you detail the risks people might encounter if they use this data?</strong></h2>
It can be risky for people to re-use data without a clear legal right to do so. For example, the data might be taken down in response to a legal challenge. Give a URL for a page that describes the risk of using this data.
<h5>Risk Assessment URL</h5>
On the web page, you should document the risks associated with using this data so people can work out if, or how, they want to use it.

&nbsp;
<h2><strong>5. Was some of this data extracted or calculated from other data?</strong></h2>
If any part of this data was sourced from outside your organisation by other individuals or organisations then you need to give extra information about your right to publish it.
<h5 id="thirdPartyOrigin_No">No</h5>
<p align="right"><a title="Where do you describe sources of this data?" href="#crowdsourced">Next: Question 7</a></p>

<h5 id="thirdPartyOrigin_Yes">Yes</h5>
An extract, analysis or smaller part of someone else's data still means your rights to use it might be affected.
<p align="right"><a title="Are all sources of this data already published as open data?" href="#thirdpartyopen">Next: Question 6</a></p>


<hr id="thirdpartyopen" />

&nbsp;
<h2><strong>6. Are all sources of this data already published as open data?</strong></h2>
You're allowed to republish third-party data if it's already under an <a href="/glossary#open-licence">open licence</a>, their <a href="/glossary#rights">rights</a> have expired or been <a href="/glossary#waiver">waived</a>. If any part of this data is not like this, then you'll need legal advice before you can publish it.

<p align="right"><a title="Was some of this data crowd-sourced?" href="#crowdsourced">Next: Question 7</a></p>

<h5 id="thirdPartyOpen_No">No</h5>
You should seek legal advice as you may not have the rights to publish the third-party data.

<hr id="crowdsourced" />

&nbsp;
<h2><strong>7. Was some of this data crowd-sourced?</strong></h2>
If the data includes information contributed by people outside your organisation, you may need their permission to publish their contributions as open data.
<h5>Yes</h5>
<p align="right"><a title="Did contributors to this data use their judgement?" href="#crowdsourcedcontent">Next: Question 8</a></p>

<h5>No</h5>
<p align="right"><a title="Where do you describe sources of this data?" href="#sourcedocumentationurl">Next: Question 11</a></p>


<hr id="crowdsourcedcontent" />

&nbsp;
<h2><strong>8. Did contributors to this data use their judgement?</strong></h2>
If people used their skill, creativity or judgement to contribute data, then copyright may subsist in the data. For example, their judgement, skill or creativity may be writing a description or selecting a subset of data to include in their contribution. If so, in order for the contributed data to published as open data, contributors should transfer or waive their rights, or licence their contribution under an open licence before you publish or re-use it as open data.
<div class="warning">
<div class="warning-title">Editor's Note</div>
Add information on how aggregators can help contributors, "<em>transfer or waive their rights, or licence their contribution under an open licence</em>" to the <a href="#crowd-sourcing-data-guide">Crowd-sourcing Data Guide</a> (to be developed).

<hr id="claurl" />

&nbsp;
<h2><strong>9. Where is the contributors licence or waiver?</strong></h2>
Provide a link to a licence or waiver that the contributors have adopted for their contribution to the data. A contributors licence or waiver will either:
<ul>
 	<li>transfer contributor's rights to you</li>
 	<li>waive their rights; or</li>
 	<li>licence the data to you so you can publish it.</li>
</ul>
<div class="example">
<div class="example-title">Example</div>
When people contribute to <a href="http://australia.census.okfn.org/">Australia's Regional Open Data Census</a>, beside the Submit button is the statement, "By submitting material to the census you agreeing to the terms of use and also to license your contribution (to the extent there are any rights in it) under the Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License."

With this agreement in place, all crowd-sourced contributions are shown on the site and published as open data under the Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License.

<h5>Contributor licence or waiver URL</h5>
<div class="warning">
<div class="warning-title">Editor's Note</div>
To do: Write a <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/odiqueensland.org.au/document/d/1AHloOZ18wmurfR7V_R7Y5AfYEZsnO3x3nILel23mIKk/edit?usp=sharing">Crowd-sourcing Data Guide</a>
<ul>
 	<li>Explain how it should be done.</li>
 	<li>Use the National Toilet Map as an example of how not to do it.</li>

It is always best when collecting crowd-sourced data to ensure that contributors supply their data under a Creative Commons Attribution Licence, or CC0 or similar, with their consent to being attributed as a “contributor to” the dataset.
</div>
<p align="right"><a title="Have all contributors agreed to the Contributor Licence Agreement (CLA)?" href="#cldsrecorded">Next: Question 10</a></p>


<hr id="cldsrecorded" />

&nbsp;
<h2><strong>10. Have all contributors agreed to the contributor licence or waiver?</strong></h2>
Check all contributors agree to the contributor licence or waiver before you re-use or re-publish their contributions. You should keep a record of who gave you contributions and whether or not they agree to the contributor licence or waiver.
<h5 id="cldsRecorded_Yes">Yes</h5>
<p align="right"><a href="#sourcedocumentationurl">Next: Question 11</a></p>

<h5>No</h5>
Contributors may need to give you the right to publish their work as open data. Without this right, you cannot publish contributor's data.
<div class="note">
<div class="note-title">Note</div>
If you are the Australian or a State government and you published the data first, you could make a claim under section 176 of the Copyright Act that as the Crown was the first publisher of the data, it owns the copyright.  This is, however, modifiable by agreement and its better to have the data licensed on submission.  This privilege is only available to the Crown, and not local government or research organisations.

<hr id="sourcedocumentationurl" />

&nbsp;
<h2><strong>11. Where do you describe sources of the third-party data?</strong></h2>
Give a <a href="/glossary#url">URL</a> that documents where the data was sourced from and the rights under which you publish the data. This helps people understand where the data comes from.
<div class="note">
On the web page, for each dataset sourced from a third-party, include:
<ul>
 	<li>the title of the dataset used</li>
 	<li>the data publisher</li>
 	<li>the licence you use the data under</li>
 	<li>the attribution in the form the publisher has requested</li>
 	<li>links to the data, publisher and licence</li>
 	<li>if you made any changes to the third-party data</li>
</ul>
<div>
<div class="example">
<div class="example-title">Example</div>
This Wedding Planner dataset includes the following third-party data:
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://data.gov.au/dataset/noosa-wedding-locations">Noosa Wedding Location</a> data by <a href="http://www.noosa.qld.gov.au/">Noosa Shire Council</a> used under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/">Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Australia</a> licence.
