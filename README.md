# open-data-certificate-help
Help for the Australian localisation of the ODI [Open Data Certificates](https://certificates.theodi.org).

This help text is pasted into the [ODI Queensland](http://queensland.theodi.org) Wordpress site. This repository was created as there is no way to keep track of changes in Wordpress and as a way for people to make contributions (via [issues](https://github.com/ODIQueensland/open-data-certificate-help/issues)) and pull requests.

If you're not comfortable with Github, you can discuss your ideas for open data certificates on [Ask ODI Queensland](https://ask.theodi.org.au/c/projects/certificates).
